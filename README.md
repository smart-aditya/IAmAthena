## Inspiration
We built this website inspired by the mental struggle faced by one of our close personal friend who faced a situation wherein she was unable to talk to anyone about her incident and felt helpless while responding to the same. So seeing this we wish that no one faces this traumatizing situation and created our website for the same.

## About the project
We are a communication platform which works to combat and raise awareness about harassment in all its forms by posting articles as well as developing a community where members can post their experiences as well. 
We work for  2 initiatives for achieving our goal. 
1. We as an organization aim to train individuals through online campaigns and webinar using various psychological defense mechanisms like bystander intervention. As you can see this is our upcoming event where we aim to carry forward the same. We believe that its not only just the victim who needs to learn defensive techniques, but also everyone deserves the resources to respond to, prevent and intervene in instances of harassment.
2. Our second initiative is where we have created an online forum which is created exclusively for I am Athena community members where members can access by logging in through the website. They can  share and post their narratives along with having discussions with other members using the forum.

## How is it built
Many of the functionalities such as the group chat function, parallax scrolling, videos, handling login and sign up for users have been achieved using JavaScript. The backend of the website is handled with the help of Google's firebase console that handles user authentication as well as stores all user data (username, email, passwords, image URLs and articles) in a JSON format on a Realtime Database.

## What's next for I Am Athena
We wish to expand our team by gathering volunteers with whom we can work on developing our research for our online resources for victim defense and bystander intervention techniques. We also aim to register ourselves as an NGO and spread our organization through society chapters in colleges and schools along with forming a team of groundwork members with the help of whom we can establish offline visits in public schools, colleges, workplaces where we will be able to spread awareness about our program and resources created through our research.
